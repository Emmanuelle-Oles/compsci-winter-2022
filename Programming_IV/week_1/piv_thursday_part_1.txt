Input/Output Streams

- streams of data
- like streamReader and streamWriter in C#

- river analogy: only see a "current" piece of data 

- we have a source of our streams

- output streams are a bit weirder : out to some destination
- we are the person placing things into the streamReader
- output things are sent to a destination

- rare but can be possible to move in the stream 

- stream has a small memory footprint


JAVA equivalent -> fileReader

FileReader: we can create onne from a file name

FileReader reader = new FileReader("in.txt");

char c = (char)


bufferedReader

scanner is very powerful 

scanner uses a delimiter to process "tokens"
default is whitespace 
processing by token not lines
