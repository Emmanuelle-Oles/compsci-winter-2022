decompiling -> opposite of compiling

java byt code is what java compiles to :)


JVM -> vm used to run java code
JRE -> runtime environment, includes libraries n jvm
JDK -> development kit, tools to compile and run java program

each version has a jdk -> thats why we needed jdk 11 when we
ran ian's code

Java SE -> what we are using 
Java EE -> companies, different flavour


review : interfaces in java

- declare that a class implements an interface
- "skeleton" aspect
- "contract" aspect when you change the signature of a method you
break the contract 
- "membership" aspect: the implementing class can be supplied 
wherever the interface type is used
