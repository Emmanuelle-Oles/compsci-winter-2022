SQLite


what is SQLite?

It is a software library that provides a relational database management system.

noticeable features: self-contained, serverless, zero-conf, transactional


usually a relational database management system requires a seperate server process
to operate using the TCP/IP protocol to send and receive requests: this is called
client/server architecture.

^^ sqlite does not work this way


self-contained

- requires minimal support from os or external library, making it usable
in any env like iphones, androids phones, game console.


zero-config

- no server process thhat needs to be config, started or stopped


transactional

all transactions in SQLite are fully ACID-compliant. 
atomic
consistent
isolated
durable

why does it have the name lite?
bc no stored procedures, no logins, restrictions on files not logins

it is open-source: you can look at the code: submit or request corrections:
then small commitments on 


it is a relational database: foreign keys



working from command prompt

dos -> command prompt

if you want to switch drive you need to type the letter


cd \  -> folder and dir are the same thing

to get a list of dir -> 


////// extremely important /////////
			environment variable : information about your computer
							- name of pc

			path variable 

files that can be executed 
when i type sqlite3 -> its the name of a executable 
			.com
			.bat
			.exe
			 etc
			
in windows

1 - searches for sqlite3 in the current dir
if found, executed

2 - it searches the path environment variable: object on a computer, 
containing an editable value



we are doing to save time
this is one of the most important question

linux/mac

- nothing 


data type introduction to SQLite 

in mySQL and PostgreSQL; they use static typing

SQLite uses dynamic type system

you are not restricted to your datatypes

5 storage classes 

null ->
integer ->
real ->
text ->
blob ->

not date or time type in sqlite

stores date as string and then interpret


what is nuget?

it is a package manager that delivers compiled source code and other files
related to code.
a nuget package takes the form of a zip file with the extension .nupkg

makes adding, updating, removing librairies easy in visual studio applications
