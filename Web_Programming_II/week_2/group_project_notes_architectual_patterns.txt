A software system architect is the set of principal deisgn decision
about the system.
a schema in which a software system runs. 

The software architecture is the blueprint for a software system's construction
and evolution.


Model View Controller is an architectural pattern that seperates an application
into three main logical components: the model, the view and the controller.

model: all data related logic
view: UI logic for application
controller: interface between model and view components
